# Javascript Pagination
### Project 2 from TeamTreehouse FSTD

In this project, you'll use a common web development technique known as "pagination" to enhance the usability of a web page.
You'll start with a page that contains a list of 54 student names, photos and email addresses. You'll write JavaScript to display 10 names at a time, and add a navigation system -- a series of links at the bottom of the page -- to let users click through the other student entries, 10 at a time.
